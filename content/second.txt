Everybody in the country
Come along and move your body
To the rhythm of Romania
My hommie Dracula, from Transylvania

I:
Hello, darling
I'm Dracula, the famous Prince Charming
Don't, don't, don't be running
Come, let me kiss you on the neck, you sexy mammy

II:
I love the way you love and I love the way you rock
I love the way you talk, it makes me really really hot
So give me, give me your kissin' and carress
Make me, make me your Dracula contessa

Everybody in the country
Come along and move your body
To the rhythm of Romania
My hommie Dracula, from Transylvania

III:
Notorious like Biggie Biggie, dangerous like 2Pac
Sneakin' like a snake he'll come around and suck your blood
D to the R-A-C, U to the L to the A
Dracula my hommie, coma', comin' yo' way
I love the way you love and I love the way you rock
I love the way you talk, it makes me really really hot
So give me, give me your kissin' and carress
Make me, make me your Dracula contessa

Everybody in the country
Come along and move your body
To the rhythm of Romania
My hommie Dracula, from Transylvania
