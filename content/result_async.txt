 Ah-ah
Ah-ah
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
Long last love has arrived
I thank God that I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
(Can't take my eyes off of you)
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel how I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby
Don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby
Now that I have you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
Long last love has arrived
Thank God that I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
(Can't take my eyes off of you)
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel how I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you, Everybody in the country
